To install: 

    Android:
        copy AndroidManifest.xml from root directory to path written at the top of the file
        run command "yarn" from root directory
    IOS:
        copy AppDelegate.m from root directory to path written at the top of the file
        cd ios, pod install, cd ..
        run "yarn"

New Change:
    Must use Yarn to install packages, since firebase doesn't work well with npm.
    Steps to use yarn:
1. install yarn from their website
2. in project, delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json (not package.json)
3. run "yarn" in the terminal

If error appears **File google-services.json is missing** on 
```
react-native run-android
``` 
then comment or remove following line from **gpsrpg/AwesomeProject/android/app/build.gradle** file
```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```
        
With new Update, firebase is integrated with character creation, so you will need to be running the server in order to run it   correctly ( I think it'll run, it just wont load your character, may cause errors) I might add some checks in the app to just skip the login stuff while in dev mode, but for now logging in with the server is best
